## How It Works

### 1. User Authentication and Login
Users log into the system via the **Authentication Module**, which ensures secure access.  
- Upon successful login, a **JWT (JSON Web Token)** is issued to verify the user session.  
- Only authenticated users can interact with the chatbot.

### 2. Message Reception
The user's message is received by the **FastAPI backend**, which acts as the central server:  
- Handles incoming requests  
- Routes queries to the appropriate processing modules  

### 3. Chat Processing Module
Before sending the message to the AI:  
- User input is **cleaned and preprocessed** (e.g., removing unwanted characters, handling typos, emojis)  
- The prepared input is forwarded to **Gemini AI** for response generation  

### 4. Gemini AI ‚Äì Response Generation
**Gemini AI** generates:  
- Natural, human-like responses  
- Policy-compliant and relevant answers  
- Context-aware replies for a smooth conversational experience  

### 5. Session Management
The **Session Management Module** keeps track of the conversation:  
- Updates conversation history  
- Maintains context for multi-turn dialogues  

### 6. Integration and Response Delivery
The **Integration Module**:  
- Formats the AI-generated response for display  
- Sends the response back to the user interface  

### 7. User Receives Response
Finally, the user receives the chatbot‚Äôs reply in real time, ensuring:  
- Context-aware answers  
- Accurate, human-like conversation  
- Seamless interaction experience
