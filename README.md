üõ´ ASAPP ‚Äì Airline Customer Support Chatbot

1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Statement

1)The goal of this project is to build a conversational AI system capable of providing natural, human-like responses to customer queries related to airline services.

2)Unlike traditional bots with predefined responses, this system is designed to:

3)Understand open-ended inputs.

4)Maintain context across multiple turns.

5)Ensure all replies adhere to airline-specific policies.

Key Objectives:

1)Understand and respond to any airline-related customer message naturally.

2)Maintain conversation context and multi-turn dialogue for continuous interactions.

3)Stay on topic and avoid off-topic or unsafe responses.

4)Comply with airline policies in every reply.

5)Deliver responses with low latency for real-time usability.

Form the final layer of the customer support bot architecture ‚Äî integrating natural language understanding, policy enforcement, and conversational flow management to create a human-like, policy-compliant support experience.
